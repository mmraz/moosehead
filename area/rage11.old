Here stands the Guardian to the Elemental Plane of Water, glaring at you with undisguised hatred.

The Guaridan to the Elemental Plane of Water is an impressive figure.  Standing

baleful gaze is unblinking and no one who does not have the King's blessing has
ever passed the threshold he guards.

Entry to the Elemental Plane of Water~
You stand at the entry to the Elemental Plane of Water.  A large archway made
apparently of rivers of water and ice stands before you.  Stretching away as
far as your eyes can see, a wall of rushing, impenetrable water prevents you
from going any further without passing through the arch.

The Elemental Plane of Water~
Every direction looks completely the same.  No matter which way you turn, all
you can see is the ripples and wavering of the opressive water around you.
The temperature changes suddenly from boiling hot, causing huge bubbles of
steam to form, to freezing cold, creating huge chunks of ice and back again
without any notice.

The Elemental Plane of Water~
Every direction looks completely the same.  No matter which way you turn, all
you can see is the ripples and wavering of the opressive water around you.
The temperature changes suddenly from boiling hot, causing huge bubbles of
steam to form, to freezing cold, creating huge chunks of ice and back again
without any notice.

Outside the Watery Castle~
You stand outside what appears to be a large castle constructed completely from
ice and water.  The walls rise high above you, waving and shimmering in the slight
currents.  A large gate stands before you, but the dark water prevents you from
seeing inside.

Inside the Watery Castle~
You stand inside a large castle, who's walls appear to be constructed of water
and ice.  While it might seem easy to pass through the walls, whenever you
approach one, the current pushes you back into the middle of the passage.  The
passage itself is, of course, relatively easy to navigate.

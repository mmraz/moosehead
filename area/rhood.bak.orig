You see that this is truly delicious pastry.  Must be made by a Dane from
Denmark (which surely is not the capital of Sweden!).  Former ruler of
Scandinavia, England, Northern Germany, Northern France, Russia, Greenland,

works from behind a large desk, no doubt holding a fortune in gold and silver.

This hall is getting darker you see a faint red glow from further down the hall
but the lights on this end of the hall have long since burned out.
The hall continues west and there are private rooms to the north & south.

A plain bedroom~
This is a plain bedroom with a dim red light in the corner.  You aren't kinky

The room of unique desires.~
This almost looks like the costume room of a theatre.  There are outfits all
around from Little Riding Hood (wich the Yinn tend to like) to the naughty
school teacher.  You look over at a plaid skirt & think, hmm I wonder what she'd
look like in that outfit.

The room of painful pleasures~
Oh my, very kinky.  There are whips, chains, handcuffs and strange devices that
you cant even imagine the use of.  You feel very nervous, yet excited.

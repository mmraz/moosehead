so that whomever can defeat the challenges I have put before you can take
up my staff to defend this realm from the evils that plague it. I have
set up a series of riddles and puzzles to ward of those that would take
the staff for their own selfish reasons. I pray that a just soul takes up
the staff and defends the realm as I once did.

The front lawn~
You are on the front lawn of what looks to have been a beautiful mansion at
one point in time, but it has now become dilapidated and appears to be
deserted. Most of the windows are boarded up, but you can hear a few
shutters banging in the wind. Also, oddly enough, you can hear what sounds
like voices coming from the inside...

The Grand Foyer~
You have entered the grand foyer of the house. It is a large and spacious 
room, and is rather dusty and dark. You can't quite tell where the light in 
this room is coming from, it just seems to be coming from everywhere. There
are many small endtables and such, displaying pictures, vases, and the like.
A large chandelier hangs from the center of the ceiling, and a large
spiraling staircase leads up to the second level. There is also a door to the
north, and one to the south.

This room is dusty and smells of stale air. As you look around, you see some
dust covered velvet chairs. There are some books and magazines on tables,
and a lamp lighting the room. Also, oddly enough, there is a fire crackling

is even the occasional tapestry hanging from the wall. As you look back down
the staircase, you can see that you are leaving your footprints in the dust,
obviously no one has travelled up these stairs in a very long time.
The stairs are creaking under your weight, and you wonder if one will give
out when you step on it...better be careful.

The walls has been painted with white centuries ago, but the time has

of a human knee. Tiny {Ccradle{x is in the center of the room rocking from

that you can barely see what is under it. The window on the wall gives
barely enough light to see where you put your feet.

A Hallway~
You are in a long bright hallway, with lot of portraits and doors to the
rooms of the second level. Walls are painted white and carpets on the floor
muffles the sound of your steps. From behind some doors you can hear laughter
and kids playing, from others just birds chirping outside open windows.
Stairway down has been painted recently and cannot be used yet.

You are on the front lawn of what looks to have been a beautiful mansion at
one point in time, but it has now become dilapidated and appears to be
deserted. Most of the windows are boarded up, but you can hear a few
shutters banging in the wind. You notice some bushes that line the front of the 
house.

A room under a bush~
You find yourself under a bush in a very small, concealed space.  You can only 
guess that this is a room of some sort.  The walls are made of dirt and roots of 
surrounding plants.  You can hear unrecognizable voices above.  Perhaps you should
stay here until they are gone.

The Great Room~
You have entered the great room. The room is quite large and spacious. You look up 
and are not quite sure if you see the ceiling or not.  The walls are now dusty and 
the most of the wallpaper has been shredded and torn.  Candles along the wall gives
you light to see. You begin to wonder why they are even lit, but then are glad to 
just have some light. A stone fireplace is located in front of you. As you walk  
closer to it, you begin to wonder if someone has been here for the coals still give 
a small amount of warmth. The dusty, grand piano in the corner now only has 2 legs.
There is a picture on the wall.

Kitchen~
You find yourself in a large room that appears to be a kitchen. The counter top is 
painted with blood and you notice large pieces seem to be missing.  The ragged edges 
suggests that a sharp object was the cause. Empty cabinets partially hang along
the wall. You can tell that the tiled floor use to be checkerd, but like the counter
it is spotted with blood. You notice a screen door that leads out the back.

A pebbled walkway~
It is obvious that you are at the back of the house. The pebbled pathway you are on 
is very dark. You look up only to to see a starless, night sky.  The moon barely
peeks from behind a cloud. The back of the house is very delapitated. Pieces of old 
shutters lay on the ground beside you. The paint has chipped off and large cracks 
have formed in the wood. You see a screen door to the south that enters the house.  
To the west stands an old cellar.

The room is completely dark when you enter the room. A sick feeling in your stomach 
lets you know that you are not alone. You reach for your light and have second 
thoughts of whether or not you should use it.  Unfortunately, your curiosity gets 
the better of you. The sick feeling in your stomach grows worse as you look around.
The slippery walls and floors are painted with splatters of blood. Below you see 
but a pile of dead bodies. All questions of what that pugent smell is now leaves your
mind. You freeze as you notice that the pile of bodies slowly begin to move...

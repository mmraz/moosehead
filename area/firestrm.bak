of existence? Arthur has proven himself the vessel of God, of his
divine wisdom. Who is to say that Arthur's absence is not a result of
his continuing on God's path. I hope that whereever he is, God is with
him."

mountain of glory upon himself already? I resent that he would go out
questing without bringing the very knights sworn to protect his life.
This dishonor will not be forgotten quickly."

foolishness is only a cover, while they try to keep Camelot together.
As Arthur never produced an hier, the kingdom and rulership could fall
to King Mark! Kay knows this and won't even tell US, the most loyal
of Arthur's knights. The Blood flowers have bloomed, meaning royal blood
has spilled. If the ancient writings are correct, this could only mean
that Arthur is dead, and there is no one to replace him."

servants and horses. Quite clearly they were questing. The ancient
scroll that Arthur continually examined was of a religious nature, but
I took no more than a casual glance, as I provided safe passage for
him to the shore."

isn't, a knight he isn't, and he is not nearly large enough to fill the
chair in which his postierior rests. Why Arthur entrusted him, I have no
idea. Clearly Arthur has made an error in judgement. Perhaps the loyalty
that I've shown was also a failure in judgement as well."

not contain him. Am I to ask my people to fight and die for a King that

dew. The swords of the enemy are sliding ever closer to the very

us to favor in the eyes of God. It was evident that Arthur understood

of Mordred. Our magic is strong, our cause is true, and Mordred will be

a fool of rich parentage. Arthur has always been the best bet for
Camelot. For his leadership has meant peace and prosperity. His absence
of two months has disrupted trade, production and taxation. The people
are preparing for war! Should King Mark be able to provide the stability
of the growth of Camelot, I for one, might be tempted to support him."

exiting the chambers of Guenevere a day before Arthur left in quest.
I propose that Arthur searches for his lady love that has not been
seen since the night of Melagrance's tresspass. I further suppose
that Melagrance has hidden her, to remove Arthur so King Mark might
seize the reins of power in Camelot. Though devilishly clever, the
plan will not succeed, for nothing will stop Arthur from saving
Guenevere from whatever fate befalls her."

Gilmere tells you: "The bloodflowers have bloomed, but have they
bloomed for Arthur or for someone else? Did Arthur decide to quest to
avoid a plot against his life, only to have Kay suffer his intended fate?
Kay's health has declined, and perhaps, his rulership is what has
brought the flowers to bloom. There are strange happenings at the court
of Camelot. For instance, why would Arthur have gone questing without
excalibar?! I have come by the knowledge that the Lady of the Lake
posesses Arthur's sword once again. Perhaps Arthur is dead, and Kay's
affliction is a result of a witch's curse on all the rulers of Camelot."

Arthur received advance notice of my plan, and fled with her, rather
than be defeated in battle."

false hopes of undoing the past, and endure the consequence of your
actions. A better man might have saved Pendragon the pain which he is
about to suffer. But I am merely a old man with too much knowledge and

The knight Gringamore~
The knight Gringamore stands, shouting for Kay to reveal the whereabouts of Lancelot.
~
Gringamore tells you: "Lancelot has disappeared, whether it is in aid
of his lord, which I doubt, or fear of me, I do not know. However, it
would be an unforgivable offence for Lancelot to die at the blade
of another man. Should the need arise, I will rescue him from the very
nether realms, and nurse him back to health myself, that I might
kill him in chivalrous combat!"

knight lancelot~
The knight Lancelot~
The knight Lancelot stands mesmerised by the blooming flowers in his hands.
~
Lancelot tells you: "Beautiful flowers the color of blood, and it is I
that caused them to bloom. A gardener I am not, nor clearly am I the sun
or the clensing rain. I am but a murderer whom has caused the blood
royal to stain the earth of Camelot. It seems so long ago that I did
gain the sight of Guenevere, racing to gain quiet sanctuary in the
garden bower. My foolish heart did follow, and cornered her withing the
flowered walls and forced her to submit her misery for consolation. In
my consoling her, she did reveal her love for me. And in consoling her
I did hold her. And in holding her my lips brushed her lips, and my
body comforted her body, and we did fall to slumber. In this state we
were when Arthur found us. Arthur's actions did spill the blood royal,
but the fault mine! It was as sure as truth that it is my hand that
drove his sword through flesh. What chore did I have but to undertake
this quest, that I might redeem myself in the sight of God, and Arthur?
Am I condemmed by my firey passion to spend eternity in firey hell?"

King Mark tells you: "What then? Arthur gone? Well is it something I
should shed a tear over or perhaps rip my cloths in mourning? This
changes nothing. His reign was at an end when the day began that I decided
to rule. This will only ease the transition to Norman rule. I hold great
respect for Pendragon, and for that reason I am glad to pass on the
necessity of killing him. And as for Kay? He is merely a nuisance, that
has already been taken care of."

The knight Kay~
The knight Kay sits uncomfortably in a throne too large for him.
~
Kay tells you: "A friend Arthur is, but why he has chosen me to the foul
punishment of leadership was as confounding to me as his departure.
I can not control this court. It's men despise me and do not respect me,
and openly flaunt their desire for my demise. The stress of the position
so unwelcomly found at mine feet has, I fear, impacted greatly upon my
health. I am weak as a kitten and unable to defend myself against even
the swords at my breats plate, much less the daggers at my back. Why is
it that I should have the dishonor of presiding over the fall of Camelot?
When, Arthur, will you return to put things right?!"

The knight Percivale stands firm, bidding you to go no further.
~
Percivale tells you: "Please, stay your advance. You do not wish to
continue. I can give you fair witness of this, as I proceeded, when good
sense advised a hasted retreat! Following my foolish curiosity I did find
the reason for Arthur's absence, his driven search, and his great shame.
Arthur's noble soul lies stained by grevious murder, and I have added his
dishonor to my own soul. My honor demands unflinching loyalty to Arthur,
but it is a dishonorable path he follows. I would rather drive my sword
through the breast of an honorable man, than face the conflict that
rages within my head."

The knight Mordred~
The knight Mordred sits back in his chair, his blond locks bouncing with laughter.
~
Mordred tells you: "This is too rich! At the fruition of my plan to
humble and excise the great Pendragon from the land of Camelot, he
mysteriously vanishes of his own accord. My feeding of the delusions
of the fool Mark, and the adling of Merlin through the contamination
of his magics that he might be able to protect my father, all for
naught. As the blood flowers bloom, I know in my heart that his fool
head sits atop a barbarians pike, or in the intestine of a beast.
Much is it like harvesting wheat and grinding it to bread, only to
have bread fall from the heavens. But do I find disappointment or
grief at my misplaced effort? No! I could not have done better. My
father is undone! All that I must do is shake my head in wonderment
and control great gales of laughter."

A luminecent hand gripping a blood covered sword, breaks the water's surface.
~
The Lady of the Lake tells you: "I am the lady of the lake. Guardian
of Camelot's magical heritage. I hold in mine hand Excaliber, the
sword of Pendragon. But why the weapon of a king be so carelessly flung
to the lake is beyond my centuries of comprehension. Why the blade
might be covered in the purest, red blood, so thick that even the
waters of ancient healing could not wash it away, is also outside my
understanding. What foul circumstance could cause a king to abandon
a sword that is clearly his birthright?"

arthur king~
King Arthur~
King Arthur holds the Holy Grail to Guenevere's cold, pale lips.
~
Arthur tells you: "Aye. I am sorry you have come. It is true, I have
slain my lady. It was a cold evening, and upon alert of some foul knight
making advance upon the chambers of Guenevere, I perchance searched the
garden for a clue to her whereabouts. In upon this very spot I
regretfully did trod, and in this place was Guenevere, her soft form
finding solice in the strong arms of mine own champion and friend. A
killing rage overcame me! I drew the bright sword of Camelot, Excaliber
from my side and drove it, with great violence, through her sleeping
breast, with steadfast intention to follow with both Lancelot, and mine
own self. But upon withdrawing the blade I was consumed with such regret
that mine only hope was that wishing upon wish would allow me to recind
the most horrible deed and bring the lifeblood back to my lady love.
I put Excaliber to mine own throat, and offered mine own life that she
might live, but Lancelot stayed mine hand, and offered his own in
penance. But alas, niether sacrafice could undo the deed that we wished
so profoundly undone. We ran to the tower of Merlin in the hopes that
his mysterious magics might somehow hold the secret of life. But an
answer he did not have. Frantically we searched the library for any
clue to action, and finally, Merlin did find a story of the cup of
Christ, the Holy Grail, that had been known to resurrect the dead. I
resolved to find the artifact that Guenevere might taste sweet air once
more, and set off, leaving Kay the command of Camelot. And we did quest
far to the east, and we did find the cup of Christ. Now I care for
nothing else save administering these sips of water that Guenevere
might once again live long enough to accept my apologies, and perhaps
some day, should this happen, I may be able to forgive myself."

Although most would have assumed her to be little more than a common
young girl who kept the weeds from Guenevere's garden, Blyth had a
mysterious past. Rumors abound that she was having an affair with one
of the knights of Camelot. She disappeared suddenly and soon thereafter
the cries of her tortured soul could be heard eminating from the garden
she tended with such care.

The shining path to the Castle~
The golden path leads you to a great oaken drawbridge, behind which
lies the legendary power and court drama of Camelot. This huge
oaken drawbridge is currently down. Good thing too, the guard at the
gate does not look to be in a very friendly mood. He seems troubled
by something. Perhaps the rumors you have been hearing of turmoil in
Camelot have reached his ears aswell.

church, the stables of Camelot house and feed the finest stock of
horses in the known world.

The Entrance to the Round Table of Camelot.~
As you part drapes of royal purple and enter the room, you are
astonished at the scene before you. A great oaken table rivals anything
you have ever seen, both in size and craftsmanship. But it is the men,
glorious and terrible, that catch your notice. These men, the noble
protectors of Camelot, are at each others throats with words, and were
it not for the table between them, likely with swords aswell.

The chair of Sorlons holds the oblong crest of yellow and gold that
denotes the ruler of the south eastern hunting lands. On the table a
gleaming longsword lies. Sorlons adds his scale of hunters to the side
of Arthur's men, and continues to send men to the armies, even in
Arthur's absence.

soil, the mark of the ruler of the grain bearing lands of the south.
A simple, but soundly constructed flail of silver rests on the table.
Ulfius, a farmer at heart, loves the peace of Arthur's rule and is upset
at the unease by his absence.

The Chair of Balin~
The crossed swords against a sky of blue, brand the chair of the
stalwart warrior and commander, Balin. His huge and awsome looking two-
handed sword, notched and nicked is his silent witness to his skill in
battle. His anger is not due to Arthur's departure, but that he undertook
a quest without taking his knights with him.

The silver against blue of the crest of Bedicere belies his lordship of
the mercia, and his sharpened military fork is another legacy of rulership.
Being from the far south, he feels distanced from the happenings of the
court and demands that Kay reveal what he knows of Arthur's disappearance.

Although a small and indistinctive man, the dried blood on his simple
sword marks him as the master, and premier hunter of the southern lands.
It is rumored that Berel may know something of Arthur's disappearance. If
he does, so far he has said nothing.

seat of his station. He resents Kay's leadership of the Round Table
feeling that his lack of knighthood makes him unsuitable for the post.

The Chair of Clegis~
The red and orange shield crest of Clegis adorns his simple seat, granted
to him by his lordship of the south eastern settled areas and lakes.
His morningstar is simple and mostly unused. Clegis fears the power that
King Mark has achieved in the short time of Arthur's absence, and wonders
if King Mark might succeed in taking over the Round Table.

The Chair of Persidies~
The lord knight, and commander of Arthur's eastern army displays crossed
axes on a background of red and green plaid as the crest of his chair.
His huge battleaxe firmly marks his place at the court of the knights of
the round. Persides has vowed to protect Arthur's steward while Arthur
is questing. He also fears that Kay is too weak to control the court
and that war is imminent.

The Chair of Epinogris~
The symbol of the guardian protector of the churchlands of the north
is a golden cross against a shield of silver. His golden cross-topped
staff marks his station in the church, and his place in the court. It
is rumored that he does know the reason that Arthur has left, and the
smug grin he has been seen wearing lately would suggest his approval.

The Chair of Ebel~
The guarding of the north eastern villages brands his chair with a white
lance and shield against a background of blue. His short lance marks him
as a knight of the renoun, and powerful force in tournaments. While he
would rather be engaged in chivelrous combat, he will not leave Persides'
side until he knows that the court is safe from the clutches of King
Mark.

The Chair of Galagers~
The lord of the southern lands bears a bold crest of celtic knotwork
on a green background. As the only tie between the magical forest druids
and the court of Camelot, Galagers holds a high place in the Round Table.
His small short sword belies his real power, and he has been stockpiling
magical defenses since arthur left. Rumor has it that Merlin has withdrawn
to his tower, and Galagers may be the only chance to defeat the magic
of Mordred.

like it's twin on the back of the throne of Arthur himself. The noble
sword "Galentine" lies upon the table, it history of vengence spawning
endless folklore. The drinking, belligerent, hotheaded knight is seen
to be tense and aloof. His mind is elsewhere...could he know the real
reason for the king's absence?

The Chair of Melias~
The orange and blue plaid tartan of the ruler of the high northern
lands is afixed to a chair of high-standing. As the ruler of the
richest domain of Arthur's followers, his wealth built the castle
that is home to the round table. However, with Arthur missing and
the Norman armies gaining strength, his loyalties seem to be
dividing.

The Chair of Managgan~
The chair of the ruler of the northern celtic lands shows a design
identical to the crest of Galagers, but with the colors reversed.
It has been thought that this was intentional, to show the unity of
the celtic lands. Secretly, however, the religious differences
between north and south have been growing, but likely will never be
as serious as the great adversity before Camelot this day. Managgan
places an ornate broadsword at his place to show the skill of his
people as artesans.

The Chair of Lionel~
The grey shield across the setting sun is afixed to the chair
of the knight of renoun, Lionel. His noble army is the guardian
force of Camelot, and the honor and glory brought to him by chivilras
combat ensure him, and his sword "BrightJustice" a place in Arthur's
court. Although Lionel has his finger on the pulse of the warlike
Norman's, he has been seen keeping an eye to Melagrance.

The Chair of Gilmere~
The lord and protector of the northern hunting lands has a simple
green, yellow, and blue plaid tartan as a crest, and an even more
simple broadsword. His lack of adornment does not mean that the
knight is a simple man, for he is a follower of intrigue. Lately
rumors suggest his investigations have turned up the prospects of a
conspiricy to foul play. Only he and the high court officials know
what shadows he may have uncovered.

The Chair of Turquire~
The knight Turquire was an ardent supporter of Arthur's court, and truly
a knight of the renoun. But something happened to turn the master of all
the southeastern lands away from Arthur, and his red and yellow plaid
tartan to King Marks's banner. His great "Spear of Destiny", a religious
artifact that might turn the tide of battle, should the separate factions
go to war, proves his noble past. His future, like the future of the
court of Camelot is uncertain.

His weapon, "The Witch Hammer" is an embodiment of his hatred of all
magic, and Merlin in particular. Phelot has been rumored to have forged
an unholy aligence with Mordred to weaken Merlin. His true intentions
remain an mystery.

tartan, marking his chair, and matching the black of his heart. His cold
and thoughtless brutality is personified by his weapon, "The Norman
Scourge", which sits as lifeless as it's victims in front of him.
It is rumored that Melagrance has design on Guenevere herself, and it's
a safe bet that his intentions fall far from courtly love.

The son of Arthur holds a place on the court simply by virtue of his
bloodline. It would be mistake, however, to believe that his power is
limited by his lack of lands or soldiers. His support, or absence
thereof, is the real exercise of power in the court. His magical prowess
is respected and feared, but his agenda is unclear save for his hatred
of Arthur. For now, he watches, and waits, for Arthur return while his
power penetrates Arthur's court like his "Serpents Tooth" stiletto
through ringmail.

King Mark's throne, a smaller, sick parody of Arthur's, holds the crest
of the Norman cross, marking him as the true ruler of the Norman people.
His agenda is to bring all lands under Norman rule. His claymore, named
"The Norman Cross" is the legendary sword of rulership, and it sits only
inches from his hand. Impatent and brash, King Mark will stop at nothing
to take all that Arthur has, and become all that Arthur is. It is
rumored that the King may owe allegence to someone even more powerful
than himself.

This is the main seat of power in Camelot, where the knights take any

the stuart of Arthur, and left in haste, the nominal leader of the Round
Table. However, although a capable administrator, he is niether knight
nor leader and is not respected. With each passing day of Arthur's absence
Kay loses more and more control to the factions gaining power at his expense.
Kay is unable to stem, or even slow, the changes, and fears for his life
at the hands of Arthur's detractors.

slumber still resting comfortably upon her face, would abey the gaping

queen, perhaps only God and Arthur know. With a single blooming rose
lain across her chest, she lies in state, from untimely death.

The Everlasting Rose~
At the center of the garden grows the everlasting rose, the ancient
and beautiful flower that is rumored to have existed since before
time began. Perhaps a flower from the garden of Eden itself, it was
lovingly transported to the garden by Arthur himself, to grace
his garden forever.

The Joust~
The valiant White knight and evil Black knight perform a mock battle
for the joy of the peasants. Not real knights, their battle seems 
amusing. Some day they may gain standing at the Round Table, but not
today.

The Rolling Hills at the edge of the Forest~
Both the forest and the path you've been following end abruptly as a
small river cuts in front of you. The swift current of the river
persuades you to find a method of crossing other than swimming.
Looking around, you see a fallen tree not too far down the bank of
the river. You carefully make your way across the tree to the other
side of the river. Before you lies yet another path, very similar
to the one you just left. The path heads north through the smooth,
rolling hills towards the silotette of a castle far in the distance.

Further down the Dirt Path~
The path widens slightly as you continue on. You're vision starts
to grow acustomed to the dim lights, and you see the abundance of
wildlife surrounding you. This section of the forest is very well
hidden.

The Dirt Path continues~
The dirt path you were on seems to continue past the path leading north.
The trees in this part of the forest seem much taller and more ancient
than the ones further back on the trail. The sun's rays are barely
piercing through the dense canopy.

The Path through the Rolling Hills~
As you continue to travel the path before you, the castle grows closer
and closer. Even though the castle is still a fair distance away you
begin to recognise where you must be. You feel drawn towards the
majesty of this fine structure. Your steps quicken as you approach the
crest of this small hill that the path leads you up. As you reach the
top, you get your first full view of.....

Under The Round Table~
You are hiding under the huge round table where all the knights 
of Camelot make the decisions considering their next moves in
battle field. From here you are able to hear all the talk and get the
information you have been paid for by the enemy of Camelot. You are
able to sneak back into shadows of sewers in down through the hole
created by you ancestors of old. Stay quiet or you will be noticed,
captured and tortured for information!

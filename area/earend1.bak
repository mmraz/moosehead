Mayor Stan~
Stan the Mayor~
Stan, the Mayor of Wooster, stands here
~
A gawky, balding academic, Stan, the Mayor of Wooster, seems an odd choice for
the leader of such a warlike group of people.  He is, however, a master at
logistics and long-range planning.  Very often he saved the town, not by his
sword, but by his pen.  Stan is beloved by the people of Wooster and is often
seen walking the streets so as not to get out of touch with his people's needs.

The Lord of Kenyon~
The Lord of Kenyon struts around proudly.
~
The Lord of Kenyon stands here.  The House of Kenyon is an old one but one
that has fallen in stature over time.  The Lords of Kenyon are not aware
of this fact however, and their pride is legendary.  This Lord is a vain
and haughty man, he had sworn an oath that he will humble the people of 
Wooster and is assembling a massive army to do so.  His leadership skills
might just be the downfall of his grand ambitions.

The Yeomen of Oberlin are not known for their fighting ability.  In
fact the only reason this poor sap is here is because Lord of Kenyon
threatened to beat him up if he didn't come and fight.  The Yeoman
of Oberlin would much rather be back home reading a book, or enjoying
one of his "herbal cigarettes".

it for Jackie to do.  Jackie looks a bit frazzled right now, it might not

This ferocious beast comes from the swamps of Alleghany.  It took the Lord
of Kenyon an entire company of men to capture this particular specimen.
Alleghany Gators are feared throughout the land for their ferocity, cunning
and deadliness.  This beast could bring about the downfall of Wooster. 
And it looks like it's going to be your downfall as well.

of Witt are sentient creatures who take great delight in causing mayhem.
It took a company of the Lord of Kenyon's finest troops to corral this
mammoth beast.  A creature like this can level an entire village by itself.

this simple fact then the people of Wooster will not be forced to beat
on you.  Thank you and have a nice day.

The Road to Wooster~
You are standing on the middle of a large plain.  The sky above is blue, and 
the rolling hills are covered with waist high grass.  Stretching north is a

You now stand before the south gate of Wooster.  It is an impressive stone and
iron affair that seems to have taken a beating in its long lifetime.  Since the
people of Wooster are enjoying a period of peace the gates are open for all to
enter.  Of course you could just go home.

This is Beall Avenue, which in the curious dialect of Wooster is pronounced
"bell".  Beall Avenue is the major roadway in the town of Wooster.  The street
is with brick and the buildings around you also  demonstrate the skill with 
which the inhabitants craft buildings of stone.  To the north lies more of
Beall, while the gates are directly to the south.

buildings are solid and tall.  Beall Avenue continues to the north and south.
To the east you notice a sign over an open door reading "Ye Olde Shoppe of

beakers, and other strange objects.  The shop is a mess, but presumably an
organized mess.  Leroy has been providing alchemal services to the town for
for years upon years and he is a beloved figure in the community.  On a desk
you notice a tome labeled "CDC" it looks rather dog-eared, it must contain
Leroy's favorite recipes.

bustle about, seemingly oblivious to the grandiose scene in front of them.
Beall Avenue runs through the square in a north-south direction.  To the east

a map of Wooster and the surrounding area.  There is a staircase leading up
to General Barnes' private office, and a staircase leading down to the Vault,
where the records are kept.

The Entrance of the Enemy Camp~
This is the camp of the NCAC...the North Coast Armed Conference.  Ok, so the name
is kind of stupid, but they didn't have much time to come up with a snazzy  
acronym.  Anyway, the NCAC is a loose allegiance of towns, cities, and villages 
dedicated to humbling Wooster, and stealing the treasures contained inside it.
In all honesty they're mostly a bunch of bumblers, but this time they have two
secret weapons...better watch your step.

Lincoln Way~
For the curious Lincoln was a great warrior who set off to travel the
distant lands.  Sketchy reports have come back that he is now a person
of great power in the land of Boinga...some rumors even claim he is a god.
Lincoln Way meets Liberty Avenue to the north, and Bever road to the south.

Galpin Hall is the administrative nerve center for Wooster.  Stan the Mayor
has his office here, though he is very rarely there.  Galpin is an unassuming 
little building, quite a departure from the grandiose architecture that seems 
so prevalent in the rest of Wooster.  Could it be that the civil servants of so
Wooster believe themselves to be just that, servants of the people?  Seems 
hard to believe.  At any rate Stan's office up that flight of stairs in the back.  
Other than that the only exit is the way you came.

The Pine Glade~
The pine glade is a place where the mind can be free and the body can relax
from the constant tension of battle.  The ground is soft but crunches
slightly under your feet.  The forest floor is essentially a blanket of dead
pine needles littered over the ground, the result of years of the
magnificent trees shedding their needles.  The golden sun peeks through the
pine boughs that frame the perfectly periwinkle blue sky.  The air is silent
and still.  Occasional shrill but pleasant bird calls break the silence and
echo through the fresh air.  You feel yourself slipping into an almost
heavenly meditative trance as you stand here and witness nature at her
communal best.  Like another plane of existence, a near nirvana, this
ethereal pine glade is a wonderful place to rest and restore your life force.

Nyaxtor's Lair~
You step into a seemingly dank and lifeless cavern.
 
Soft and soulful jazz music eminates from the walls. You hear a voice from
somewhere in the dark back of the cave say "Hey baby, come on back here and
I'll show you a good time,".  Taking this unknown voice up on its offer ,
you step cautiously towards its source.  Suddenly a lava lamp lights up and
spreads its groovy light throughout the cave.  The light reveals what looks
like a really nifty bead curtain.  You part the beads and enter the hidden
room. The floor is carpeted with a very hip shag rug.   Sitting temptingly
on a bean bag chair is a youthful and virile looking silver dragon.  He
extends a claw and pulls you down into his lap, tail thumping happily on the
floor.  "Welcome to the Lair o' Love, baby," he says with a devilish grin...

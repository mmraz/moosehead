============================================
In Memory of Fluzel (Founder of Matook):
 
Anger rules the world
Anger feeds the starving soul.
Run and hide when anger hits
for anger rules the world.
 
Love life when all is calm
run and hide when not
for fear resides in those that think
that anger is not hot.
 
Love is blind to those you see
who wish to live in harmony.
One cannot love with anger and hate
for fear will always rule one's fate.
 
Fear is a word best described
as a disease one has caught up inside.
Run young child run born free
for fear is not your destiny.
 
Health and happiness are your sword
for love and laughter are your goal.
To live a life full of peace
One must love or see it decrease.
============================================
The Church of Matook was built with help
from too many to name, yet they deserve
great credit for their faithful service
on the path to Matook.  Many thanks to
all the believers in Matook.
 
May Matook Protect you.

You have entered the First church of Matook. The hallway leads to the Altar
room where brightly lit candles can be seen burning brightly. To the east

walls. Practical is the key word of this church. It is painted in bright
colors and seems to be very welcoming to anyone who enters.

death they hold vigilance over the Church and you feel quite safe within

and get back into the Temple of Matook.

the front with pews lined to the back of the room where two small doorways 
enter the confessional. If you listen closely it almost sounds like the
Heart of Matook beating above you. To the east is a library and to the west 
through the patio doors is a rooftop.

Kuno's Study and Dojo~
When you first enter the room you are shocked by the rows and rows of
spell books, scrolls, artifacts, and other miscellaneous magical items
lining the walls. You look with wondrous awe at all the legendary items
that are strewn about the room. A small wooden desk catches your eye. A
small inkwell rests on it, and various parchments are spread across the
desk's surface. Looking away from the desk you notice a large padded area
in the corner where Kuno spends his spare time meditating and practicing
his kendo. Hanging on the wall are pictures of Akane Tendo and the
Pig-tailed Girl. However, they have both been partly covered by a picture
of a beautiful angel. It can only be Petal, his loving wife.

Tacked over the pictures of the Pig-tailed Girl and Akane Tendo is a 
poster of a strikingly beautiful angel who you realize can be none other 
then Kuno's wife, Petal. Just looking at this visage of beauty soothes your 
heart and puts your mind at ease.

Behind the Portrait~
Brushing off the cobwebs you step through the ancient doorway.
Behind the portrait are very old and decaying stairs leading down.
Although it looks unused for many centuries torches still adorn the
walls and remain forever lit.

Ruiner's Cathedral Condominium~
You relax in the cathedral style dwelling of deep leather furnishings.
The black steel gates tower high into the air before you, barring your exit.
Through the huge spiked bars you can see a Gothic Cathedral style dwelling.
Large black-tarnished chains hang from the ceiling, supporting torches that
serve as lighting to the main hall.  The floor is a highly polished white and
grey marble that flawlessly spans the expanse of space.  Plush deep black
leather furniture placed sparsely around invites you to sit down and relax.
The walls are tastefully decorated with weapons and armour. The ceilings 
are over one hundred feet high, and are covered in scenes of dragon battle.

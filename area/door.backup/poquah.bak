Underneath the hovel's floorboards, you find yourself in a small room

The smurf pens~
As you wander about the pens, you see many shackled smurfs mulling
about. You almost think about freeing them, but they seem to covet their
shackles as if you plan on stealing their chains from them. Perhaps they
actually like being sold at Breedy Smurf's shop...

The Padded Cell~
You are standing in the middle of a room that has been completely covered
with thick white padding. During your stay, this is here to protect you from
harming yourself. The heliotrope light emanating from all around is mentally
soothing. As your mind drifts into oblivion, you hear the insanity induced
screams of the other inmates of this hell.
Above your head, you can see a sort of faint scrawled message on the wall
what looks to be excrement.

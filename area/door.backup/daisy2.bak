report~
The police arrived at Redfernes mansion at 8am Friday, Nov. 15.  They
were called to the scene by the housekeeper who had arrived at the
residence about 7:30 that morning.  She reported having found Redfernes
body in his bedroom.  He had been stabbed over 14 times with a two-
handed long sword.  The blood smeared sword was discovered on the 
balcony.  The maid reported that Thursday night was usually Redfernes
poker evening and that his fellow players were Vito, the Diploma Beast,
Slash, the Mind Block, and Homer.  The neighbors report, however, that
all five men left the residence at around 1am and at that time Redferne was
still alive.  The police have discovered no other leads.

Yea, I played poker with Redferne Thursday night.  Just like always.  
Nothing unusual happened.  We sat around joking and drinking beer.
Talked about what pains in the necks our women were.  Reddie (thats
what I used to call Redferne) did keep complaining about his new 
girl friend, the Queen Wasp,  though.  Said she was the jealous kind, 
always trying to keep a leash on him.  I never cared for her.  She was 
a real drag.  If I were you, Id go talk to her and find out what she 
knew.  She kept tabs on everything Reddie did and everyone he saw.

Oh, *sob* I cant believe my smoopie is really gone!  We were so in
love... he worshipped the ground I walked on.  If only he were still here!
There is no way, *I* would have ever hurt him.  Sure I worried about
other women trying to steal him from me, but he would never have 
fallen for their silly traps.  Besides I hired Foreman Floyd to follow
him around and make sure he said faithful.  And Floyd never had any
thing bad to report.  Im sorry I cant be more helpful but I do hope
you can bring to justice whoever did this awful thing!

Yea, I followed Redferne for a bit.  His psycho girlfriend hired me too.
Its really not my line of work, but I guess she thought since I am from
the working class that we are all shifty characters.  Dames!  Anyways,
Redferne found out right away that I was following him and he paid me
some good money to feed his girlfriend a bunch of lies about how he
wasnt messing around on her.  But I followed him and I know he was
meeting some hot chick at the graveyard twice a week.  The grounds-
keeper there was renting them his shack I think.  If you want to know
who she was, go talk to him...

That was just the day before he was killed.  They got into a horrible fight.  
I dont know what about... was none of my business, but the girl sure
was screaming up a storm about what a no-good so and so he was.  Naw
I dont remember her name but she had some sorta job as a guard in New

We fought last Wednesday because I wanted him to start seeing only
me.  I mean I deserve better than just an hour a week in the graveyard.
That guy had money.  He could have afforded to at least take me some
place nice.  But no... he was too worried about being seen.  He kept
saying that if his girlfriend found out shed kill him.  I bet she did it.
Besides I was working that night, you can ask anyone.

Sure, I played poker with Redferne and guys Thursday night.  Same as
always.  Nothing unusual happened.  Vito and me went out to the Market
Square Inn afterwards and had a couple of drinks.  One thing that I 
thought was kinda strange was that Redferne had sent us home kinda
early that night, he claimed that he had a meeting the next morning with
the mazekeeper.  Vito and I had no idea what it could be about cause,
Redferne is kinda picky about who he invites to his house.  Ya know?

that he had acquired it from her when she was short of cash.  However,
he broke their agreement and sold it off instead of holding it for her to
buy back.  Well, naturally she was quite upset.  If her husband, 
Montezuma, finds out shell be in very bad trouble.  Those people

Underwater~
Your ears pop from being at the bottom of the deep end of the swimming
hole.  Sunlight does not penetrate the water so it is very dark here.
Grey stone walls lie to the south and west, but the pool continues

A Dark Trail~
The woods are dark along this section of the trail.  The sounds from the
surrounding forest grow louder as your ears compensate for what your eyes
can not see.  The trail continues north and south.

A Dark Trail~
It grows darker as the trail through the woods narrows.  Your eyes begin
to deceive you, and you imagine that every branch that brushes against 
your sleeve is a monster waiting to attack.  The trail appears to only go
south, but there is large opening cut into the rocks to the north.

Entrance to a Cave~
You stand inside a large damp cave.  Light pours into the opening along
the south wall, but barely illuminates the huge space.  You can hear water
trickling down the walls and see it forming into several pools on the
ground.  There is a crack in the east wall big enough for a large man to
squeeze through.

Inside a Damp Cave~
It is very cold and dark inside this part of the cave.  A shiver runs up
your spine as the squeaks from some hidden cold-blooded animal reach your
ears.  The cave continues to the east, or you can leave through a large
crack in the western wall.

Deep Inside the Cave~
No outside light penetrates this section of the cave.  You can smell the
damp rocks that surround you and hear the sound of water drops hitting the
stone floor.  There is a small room to the east and the main part of the
caves lies to the west.

A Bear's Den~
You have stumbled into a bear's den.  There is dead grass and leaves 
covering the floor, and a wild scent in the air.  You cling to the edge of
the room, hoping not to be discovered.  The only exit is to the west.

Crushed Against the Rocks~
You dive from the top of the cliff, but your inexperience cause you to be
hurled through the air into its side.  Your body is crushed against the
rocks and lands to rest on a small ledge above the water.  You are in too
much pain to move from here.

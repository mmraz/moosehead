The Afterlife~
Your heart beats faster and your skin starts to crawl.  You've
found yourself in a large room with no apparent exit.  The room 
is poorly lit, but you can see the walls alive with activity.  
 
Shadows race across the wall and black mist swirls across the
the floor.  Open mouth faces and small hands seem to be trying to
push towards you through the ceiling.  
 
The mist at your feet starts to rise, before your eyes he appears.

Top Of The Tree~
From the top of this tree the view is breathtaking.  To the
north you see a forest rich in color.  A small funnel of smoke
is rising from within the forest, perhaps a campfire.  From one
branch you see a very thin vine, stretched across to the next
tree.  And it looks like theres a pathway at the bottom of that
tree.

The path widens and you find yourself in front of a small hut made
of branches bound together by willow whips.  A shaggy looking
place but it will keep the rain off your head.  A circular firepit
is off to the side of the small hut.  A couple chopped logs seem
to be used as seats for the firepit.
 
The small hut is to the east.

Its a small place with the very simplest of furnature.  A small

Deep Within Emerald Forest~
Having travelled for such a long time you turn to see  if
you can see where you've come from.  You realize this dense
forest has disoriented you.  You can't tell where you've been
or how you got here.  Normally this would be a bad thing, but
to be lost on such a beautiful place really doesn't bother
you too much.  You'll find your way out eventually.

you can see where you've come from.  You realize this dense
forest has disoriented you.  You can't tell where you've been
or how you got here.  Normally this would be a bad thing, but
to be lost on such a beautiful place really doesn't bother
you too much.  You'll find your way out eventually.

A Watch Tower~
From here the rangers can keep an eye out for forest fires.
Located on top of this escarpment, the tower provides you
with a spectacular view.  In the distance you think you can
see Midigard.  To the far east it seems like the forest has
all but died.  There isn't even any green leaves on the trees
as far as you can tell.  Something tells you that is not a
very fun place to visit.

The Black Market~
After pulling yourself up on a low hanging branch, you're startled 
at what you've discovered.  A small and very well hidden tree-house
built into the side of the tree itself.  The old door to it has
boards nailed across it to prevent entrance.  There is something
carved into the board.

Secret Tunnel~
You've found a secret tunnel under the Ranger's Hut.  Perhaps the
ranger that owns the hut is in bussiness with the man who runs the
black market.  This would be an ideal way to smuggle things into or
out of the forest without the other ranger's knowing.

A Small Ravine~
The tunnel has led you to a small ravine that runs along side the
forest.  Thick bush lines each side of you, you have no choice but
to follow the rocky path and see where it takes you.  Or, turn back
and forget you've ever been here.
 
To the south you see an entrance to a small tunnel, the ravine continues
to the east.

The Final Twist~
The ravine has a small stream twisting down the middle.  The footing
on each side of the ravine is loose and very difficult to keep your
leverage on.  The mosquitos once an minor irritation, are more than
happy to welcome you to their home.
 
To stay in the open stream means more mosquitos, north of you is a
thick patch of brambles.  Neither choice seems pleasant.

Entering The Maze Of Thorns~
This thick patch of thorns and brambles is unusually large.  Pieces
of torn armor hang off the sharp needles.  Obviously someone has tried
to take this path before you.  The question is where does the path take
you?  Bloodstained leaves, are not an encouraging sight, and make you
question the idea of entering.
 
As you pull your hands into your sleeves and tug your hood on tight, you
realize that maybe this wall maze of thorns, isn't to keep people from
getting in....  But from getting out.

Exhausted and delerious from loss of blood, the exits in the maze
fade out of sight.  In a panic you scan the area and all you see
are bushes full of thorns.  They seem to be closing in on you.  To
save your sanity, and your life you decide to retreat.

End Of The Maze~
Collapsing onto the path you breath a sigh of relief.  You've made
it out of that wretched maze.  However as you lay on your back peering
at the tree tops, chills run down your spine and you wish you hadn't
decided to follow the maze.  Skulls of various shapes and sizes are
hung from branches in the trees.  Some with spinalcords still attatched.
Racing to your feet you cringe at the thought of being lost in the
maze of thorns.  Maybe whatever lies ahead won't be too bad.

Others although still intact, still have maggots squirming in the
jaw, and eye sockets.  Seems whomever is responsible for putting the
decapitated heads there has found a more civil way of killing.  The
maggots mean that they couldn't have been killed long ago.

Entrance To A Small Village~
The path ends here, with two bamboo stakes complete with mounted skulls
on each side of the entrance.  The village is primative, huts made of
wood and bark, with grass roofs.  Small plumes of smoke can be seen
rising over the huts.  Faint screams in the distance get your attention.
Time to make a decision.

Although unique, what is for sale here doesn't classify as armor so far
as you are concerned.  However, this would be a great place to shop for
your next costume party.  Masks shaped like elongated heads with paint
on them seem to be a popular item.  The vests seem to be woven silk, and
the leggings are nothing more than dry leaves woven together.  One fireball
and you'd be in a lot of trouble.

The stench of maggots is almost overpowering.  Maggots crawl across
the floor, and the flies are terrible.  The floor is sticky with blood
being drained from corpses of unlucky travellers which are decapitated,
skinned and hanging from make-shift meat hooks attached to the support
beam.  Fresh heart, kiddney and liver are on sale for 5 gold pieces.
 
Seems you could be the next item for sale.

Center Of The Village~
Bone chilling screams of anguish from a young girl chained to a stake
fall on heartless ears as the crowd chants, screams and spits on her.
For some reason the girl is being burnt at the stake.  A large fire at
the base of the stake with flames 5 feet high have burnt the hair from
her head and is peeling the skin off her naked body.  The crowd is full
of women, how could they be so heartless?
 
This is obviously not a good place to be, maybe this is punishment for
discovering the town.  Either way the only civil thing to do is put
the poor girl out of her misery.  And then RUN LIKE HELL!

Muhtar's Weapons~
Scimitars, machettes, tridents and some rather unusual looking weapons
are scattered throughout the room.  Sut and filth cover the walls and the
tables.  A clean spot on one wall is very oddly shaped.  A weapon of some sort
that had hung there for years must have recently been sold.  It's shape 
resembles that of an axe blade on one side and a pitchfork on the other.
The shaft of the weapon must have been very slim, with some sort of a ball at
the end of it.  Perhaps to balance the weapon in ones hands.  It certainly
would be an odd weapon to fight with.
 
Muhtar sits behind a table sharpening his blade.  He doesn't even offer you a
greeting.  Not very personable for someone in sales.

A Path In The Village~
The dirt path takes you further into the village, past huts and small
shops.  The village is small, there isn't even anything you would
consider to be a home.  Torches line the side of the path, along with
a few bones here and there.  There's a foul smell in the air and the
smoke from the huts drifts across town preventing you from seeing what
lies ahead.
 
To the north is the center of the village, there's a crowd of people
swarming a tall pole that is ungulfed in flames.

Entrance To A Small Village~
The path ends here, with two bamboo stakes complete with mounted skulls
on each side of the entrance.  The village is primative, huts made of
wood and bark, with grass roofs.  Small plumes of smoke can be seen
rising over the huts.  Faint screams in the distance get your attention,
time to make a decision.  Fight or flee.
 
To the east is a path that leads to a dead forest.  All the trees are
wilted and a think layer of fog covers the ground.

Path To Witch's Grove~
A narrow path leading to what looks like a forest of dead trees and
bushes is lined with poison ivy.  The trees, entangled with vines are
smothered in a grey fungus.  There's no sign of animal life at all, not
even any insects walking along the path or across the dead branches
and rotting logs.

Behind The Counter~
Sneaking behind the counter wasn't the smartest idea.  Kahale isn't
going to appreciate you snooping around.  You startle Kahale as he
steps out of the meat locker.

A Small Cave~
A large black cauldron bubbles and boils over a small fire.  The
walls of the cave are shelved.  Various odd ingredients line the shelves
none of which are labelled.  There's even a funny looking mouse trapped
in a wire cage.
 
A small cot rests in the corner.
